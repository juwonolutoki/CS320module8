# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring that your code, program, or software is functional and secure involves a combination of the best tools and methodologies. For instance, Integrating automated testing into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure code is continuously tested can help verify that the software is functional. Performing regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities that confirm the software is Secure.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By engaging with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations, which can be achieved by conducting one-on-one or group interviews with users, clients, and other stakeholders. Use open-ended questions to gather detailed feedback. Another method we can use to improve user needs is to collect quantitative and qualitative data from a larger audience, this can be achieved by conducting surveys with targeted questions about user needs, preferences, and pain points. Tools like Google Forms, and SurveyMonkey, can be used.

# How do I approach designing software?
The first thing to do is to outline the technical aspects of the design, specify the technology stack, tools, and platforms to be used. Include details on programming languages, frameworks, databases, and third-party services. After which we can now establish a timeline for each phase and deliverables.
